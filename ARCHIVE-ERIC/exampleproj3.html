            <h3>A hot dog is a grilled, steamed, or boiled sausage served in the slit of a 
                partially sliced bun. The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself. 
                The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, 
                also just called frank). The names of these sausages commonly refer to their assembled 
                dish. Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide. Common condiments include 
                mustard, ketchup, relish, onions in tomato sauce, and cheese sauce. Other toppings 
                include sauerkraut, diced onions, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon and 
                olives. Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket. The hot dog's 
                cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer 
                Wienermobile.

            <h3>The word frankfurter comes from Frankfurt, Germany, where pork sausages similar to 
                hot dogs originated. These sausages, Frankfurter Würstchen, were known since the 
                13th century and given to the people on the event of imperial coronations, starting 
                with the coronation of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, as King. "Wiener" refers 
                to Vienna, Austria (German: Wien), home to a sausage made of a mixture of pork and 
                beef. Johann Georg Lahner, an 18th/19th century butcher from the Franconian city 
                of Coburg, is said to have brought the Frankfurter Würstchen to Vienna, where he 
                added beef to the mixture and simply called it Frankfurter. Nowadays, in 
                German-speaking countries, except Austria, hot dog sausages are called Wiener or 
                Wiener Würstchen (Würstchen means "little sausage"), to differentiate them from 
                the original pork-only mixture from Frankfurt. In Swiss German, it is called Wienerli, 
                while in Austria the terms Frankfurter or Frankfurter Würstel are used. Carts selling 
                frankfurters in New York City, 1906. The price is listed as "3 cents each or 2 for 5 
                cents".It is not definitively known who started the practice of serving the sausage in 
                the bun. One of the strongest claims comes from Harry M. Stevens who was a food 
                concessionaire. The claim is that, while working at the New York Polo Grounds in 1901, 
                he came upon the idea of using small French rolls to hold the sausages when the waxed 
                paper they were using ran out.
